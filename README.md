# Authentication

I'm taking a shot at authentication and server send events. 
My goal to reach with this repository is to make a SSE server which streams
different kinds of dynamic data and only be able to get to this data if you are authenticated to that data stream. 


# progress

so far I have almost completed the register and login page without authentication

# installation 

```
npm i express
```

#commands 

```
node src/server.js       --> central server

node src/client-server.js  --> satellite server
```
